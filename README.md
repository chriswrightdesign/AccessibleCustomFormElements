# Custom form elements
A collection of custom form elements, browser and device tested. 

v.02a - This project is still in progress and requires some serious testing, as this is messing with form elements there's the potential to make things non-accessible.

I'm trying to make sure these have keyboard control, are okay to use with high contrast mode, work well with screen readers and are structured as semantically as I can make them. 

Ideally, I want to test these with actual devices rather than emulators.
