# Custom form elements v.02a

## About the project

The aim of this project is to make a well-tested, multi-device friendly, accessible, skeleton of components that can easily be added to any project. Ultimately, reducing some of the friction and time-cost of making form elements accessible and device happy. 

## Aims 

Ideally, these will be progressively enhanced form elements starting with semantic markup and enhanced with browser capability.  I'll be using media queries as a qualifier for any form component that requires an adjacent/sibling selector (radios/checkboxes). Which means most components will be available in most modern browsers with exception of IE8 and below. IE8 and below will just show a standard, unstyled form element.

## Testing information

Currently each component will be tested for:
- Accessibility: Keyboard control, High contrast mode, Screen readers (NVDA, Voiceover, JAWS) 
- Different screen sizes
- Touch and pointer capable devices
- 2-in-1 touch/pointers + click capable devices (coming soon)
- Actual devices (currently I'm using a small device testing suite which includes an oldish Windows Phone, an Android 4.1.2 phone and a fairly modern iOS device, i'd like to expand device testing capabilities soon so I can cover the 2-in-1s)
